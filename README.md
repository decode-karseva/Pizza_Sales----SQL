# Pizza_Sales----SQL
# Pizza Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This SQL project analyzes pizza sales data to derive key business insights. The project retrieves metrics such as total orders, total revenue from pizza sales, the highest-priced pizza, the most common pizza size, the top 5 most ordered pizza types, daily average pizza orders, and the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue. The analyses are performed using SQL queries on a relational database containing pizza order data.

1. **Total Orders**: Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
2. **Total Revenue**: Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
3. **Highest-Priced Pizza**: Identify the pizza with the highest price.
4. **Most Common Pizza Size**: Determine the most frequently ordered pizza size.
5. **Top 5 Pizza Types**: List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.
6. **Average Daily Orders**: Group orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
7. **Revenue Contribution**: Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
